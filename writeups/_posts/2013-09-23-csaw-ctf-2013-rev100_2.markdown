For this challenge, the first thing I did was to drop the executable into IDA and give it a run with a debugger.

And there's the flag: `flag{this1isprettyeasy:)}`

For reference, here were the actual instructions:


```

.text:01131000 _main           proc near              
.text:01131000                 call    ds:IsDebuggerPresent
.text:01131006                 test    eax, eax
.text:01131008                 jnz     short loc_113101F
.text:0113100A                 push    2               ; uType
.text:0113100C                 push    offset Caption  ; "Flag"
.text:01131011                 push    offset Text     ; lpText
.text:01131016                 push    eax             ; hWnd
.text:01131017                 call    ds:MessageBoxA
.text:0113101D                 jmp     short loc_113105C

```
